# FloridaMan-PrivateEye
Included in this repository are links to datasources, general information, miscellaneous stuff that I found interesting. There may even be things that don't have a clear intention or direction. If you happen to see that, please ask. More often than not it was a thought fragment.
Everything contained here is Florida-related. There is no clear direction or meaning when I say "Florida-related" - that meaning is as incomprehensible as the people that live in the fine state.

Everytime I ask a trivial question about the states geography, bird population, or history, or current legislature, etc., there always seems to be one single person that knows every fact about Florida. And of course, the facts are absurd and seemingly farfetched, however that would be par for the course. 
I want to mimic that guy, or gal - but usually the same guy. 
There will be lists of counties, cities, etc. There will be data tables. I don't really know what else, but this is where I'm gonna dump random stuff. Florida
